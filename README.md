<h1>Welcome to MaterialsMine 👋</h1>

<p align="justify">
  Spurred by the advent of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), the platform, built on a flexible ontology-based framework, emphasizes FAIR principles and contains key functionalities of search tools, data visualization, and analysis tools. Data visualization is implemented through the use of SPARQL queries paired with visualizations based on open-source Vega-Lite specifications.
